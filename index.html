        Well hello there! My name is Monthon Paul, I was born in Los Angeles,
        California, but mostly stayed in Utah my entire life. I am a
        first-generation Asian American going after my studies. I recently
        pursuing in studying at the University of Utah for my undergrad Computer
        Engineering. My interest would be for new Software Engineering, Data
        Analysis, Web-Development (More would go further detail below).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I don't have much memory of my Childhood and didn't realy develop a
        memory until I moved to Utah at around 2009. Since then I forever stayed
        in Utah. My life experience has been full of opportunities. In High
        school particularly I did the IB program but didn't complete it due to
        having a fortunate time of becoming an Exchange student for AFS abroad
        program. There I study abroad for One year in Japan where I get to
        experience a different life and culture. In Japan, I was an exhange
        student and spend my every day life attending school and connecting with
        different people around the globe. I get to stay with a host family and
        make friends abroad which I am forever grateful for. When I return home,
        I had to dropout of the IB program as I was behind by completing the
        program. From this experience I think it is best to open myself into new
        opportunities like I did and learn new skills to help better my
        understandings
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        as a developer in many projects, I do to become persistent and
        approaching opportunities with unique perspectives. I like to be
        reliable and enjoy working with new and unfamiliar technologies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Thoughout my journey it is best to learn and teach myself of task that
        would help better myself in the field of learning and creating. This
        Website, would demostrate my passion into learning more about Web
        development and hope to display in what technologies I learn from my
        side projects & resume of what I can accomplish. My interest (that I
        explain above) are in Software Engineering as I build projects form
        courses from the University of Utah and my own interest in building
        things I like to show. Another interest is in Web-Development in either
        Front-end or Back-end Engineering, with this Website steping into the
        door with this field. Lastly, I have now completed my Data Analysis
        Course from
        <a
          href="https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none"
          target="_blank"
          >Google certificates: Data Analysis.</a
        >
        I hope that it would broaden my knowledge into developing certain new
        skills that I learned. As of right now, I am looking for any Internship
        in this incoming 2023 summer or the later years. For now It has so far
        been a journey & want to apply the skills of what I learned.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Outside of Computer Engineering, my hobbies include riding my penny
        board, hanging out with friends, playing a bit of video games, and
        listening to music.
