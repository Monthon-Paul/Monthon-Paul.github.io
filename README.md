# Portfolio: 
This is a side project where I would demonstrate my skills and abilities to build a simple Website run by Github pages.
My intention for this side Project is to help my get stated in the ideas of Frontend Development. 
I want to test out my skills and build a strong understanding with creating my first Website. 
It is pretty basics in term for a first time but I hope for years to come to improve the page and development.
