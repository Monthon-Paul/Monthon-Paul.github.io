This is a side project where I would demonstrate my skills and abilities
My intention for this side Project is to help my get stated in the background
ideas of Frontend Development. That is why my intention is to test out my skills and
build a strong understanding with creating my first Website. It is pretty basics in terms
for a first time but I hope for years to come to improve the development.
